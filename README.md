## Conway's game of life with React Hooks and Canvas
![screenshot](public/images/screenshot.png)

This repo contains [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
implemented with React Hooks. The board is rendered on `<canvas>` and in memory is represented as
a 1D array (for performance). The app also can parse `.rle` files for easier brush library management.
You can play around with the game [here](https://osvalds.github.io/react-conway/).
